/**
I spent a lot of extra time getting all the animations to work for the different sprites in the game.
Including the enemies, collectables, and player. The player took a lot of work since there are
multiple completely different animations for each different action you could take. These being,
being idle, running, jumping, falling, and dying. I also took a bit more time to improve on my
menus. You are able to pause the game by hitting escape that pulls up a menu that lets you either:
continue, restart the game, or go to the main menu. There are also similar menus for when you either
beat the game or lose. I also made it that if you lose you can choose to either restart from the 
first stage, or start over from your most recent stage, but at a cost of some points.
